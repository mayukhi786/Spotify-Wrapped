## Name
Spotify Wrapped 

## Description
We are developing an interactive web application that leverages the Spotify API to fetch and render personalized user data. We have seamless user authentication using OAuth authorization to facilitate secure and hassle-free user login, ensuring a smooth and protected experience. Dynamic user Interface utilizing JavaScript DOM manipulation techniques to dynamically generate, and update components based on the user's preferences and Spotify data. This ensures that the web app offers a personalized experience tailored to each individual user. Employ ReactJS library to handle both the frontend and backend of the application. ReactJS provides efficient rendering and component management, enabling a seamless user interface. Additionally, use HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the application, respectively. Set up the backend using Node, a versatile JavaScript runtime environment, to handle server-side operations.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
