## Name
Spotify Wrapped 

## Description
We are developing an interactive web application that leverages the Spotify API to fetch and render personalized user data. We have seamless user authentication using OAuth authorization to facilitate secure and hassle-free user login, ensuring a smooth and protected experience. Dynamic user Interface utilizing JavaScript DOM manipulation techniques to dynamically generate, and update components based on the user's preferences and Spotify data. This ensures that the web app offers a personalized experience tailored to each individual user. Employ ReactJS library to handle both the frontend and backend of the application. ReactJS provides efficient rendering and component management, enabling a seamless user interface. Additionally, use HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the application, respectively. Set up the backend using Node, a versatile JavaScript runtime environment, to handle server-side operations.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Dependencies and Integrations With Other Systems

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
